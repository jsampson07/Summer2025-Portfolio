Today’s deep dive into my banner grabber script was a crash course in both Python quirks and TLS fundamentals—and I came away with a much stronger sense of how to troubleshoot real-world networking code. I started the session wrestling with a deceptively simple f-string error: embedding a backslash in an expression isn’t allowed, so I learned to move my .strip('\n') call out of the f-string (or escape it) to avoid a SyntaxError. From there I plunged into SSL, discovering that load_verify_locations() is only for CA bundles and that client certificates must be loaded with load_cert_chain(). When my session still failed—first with “no certificate or CRL found,” then with “self-signed certificate,” and finally “IP address mismatch”—I learned how OpenSSL’s hostname checks rely on Subject Alternative Names, how a self-signed cert needs to be explicitly trusted (or regenerated with the proper SAN), and how the server_hostname parameter ties certificate CN/SAN to the address you connect to. Finally, I realized my HTTPS banner grab was hanging simply because I’d sent a HEAD request to openssl s_server -www, which only replies to GET. Switching to a GET and adding s.settimeout(3) before every recv() guaranteed my code would never block indefinitely. Altogether, today’s challenges took me through Python string parsing rules, the subtle difference between verifying and presenting certificates, and best practices for non-blocking I/O. Each error message became a teaching moment, and by methodically isolating the root causes, I transformed blocking failures into reliable, timeout-driven network probes—an experience well worth adding to my portfolio as proof of my hands-on debugging chops.
