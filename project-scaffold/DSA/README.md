# 🧠 DS & Algo Integration for Summer 2025 Projects

This repo complements my Summer 2025 plan by aligning core data structures and algorithms with hands-on projects in OS design, cybersecurity, and software development.

## 🗂 Structure

- `checklist.md` — Weekly DS&A challenges with direct connections to my core projects
- `stretch_goals.md` — Bonus topics to explore if ahead or post-summer
- `README.md` — Overview of the purpose and structure of this supplement

## 🔍 Project Context

I'll cover:

- xv6 system call and memory allocator development
- Vulnerability scanning and packet crafting with Python
- REST API development with Flask and JWT authentication

And learn:

- Key DS&A patterns (heap allocators, graphs in security, queues in schedulers)
- Debugging with GDB, profiling performance, CI integration
- Real-world application of linked lists, hash maps, tries, trees, and more

Used in tandem with `checklist.md` to track how my algorithm skills are reinforcing my systems, security, and OS work.
