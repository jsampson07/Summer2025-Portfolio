Summer 2025: Cybersecurity & Software Development Journey

Welcome to my Summer 2025 portfolio. This repository showcases my learning, growth, and hands-on projects focused on cybersecurity fundamentals and software development. My goal is not just to build projects, but to highlight the process — the progress, setbacks, and insights that come with deep, consistent learning.

Each week, I explored new tools, implemented foundational data structures, and pushed my understanding of core technical concepts. You’ll find commits and folders representing weekly challenges, new skills, and real-world applications.

Cybersecurity Track

This summer, I focused on learning core networking concepts and practical security tooling. I started with Scapy to solidify my understanding of packet-level networking, then progressed to building my own tools from scratch using low-level socket programming.

Ping Sweeper Project

- Stage 1: Implemented a basic synchronous ping sweeper using Scapy.
- Stage 2: Upgraded to an asynchronous ping sweeper using raw sockets and multithreading for faster scanning of live hosts on a given subnet.
- This project demonstrates my transition from using high-level tools to understanding and manipulating network packets at a lower level.

Software Development Track

In parallel with my cybersecurity work, I designed and developed a macronutrient calculator — a full-stack application to help users track their diet and understand their nutritional intake.

Macronutrient Tracker

- Allows users to log meals and track daily and long-term macronutrient data.
- Aggregates data to display trends and insights into eating habits.
- I plan to continue expanding this project throughout the academic year with:
  - Personalized recommendations based on age, weight, activity level, and nutritional science.
  - Smart meal suggestions.
  - Enhanced analytics and user customization features.

Weekly Themes & Data Structures

Each week introduced new data structures and tools, reinforcing computer science fundamentals while also supporting my broader goals in systems design and secure software development. These include:

- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks & Queues
- Heaps
- Hash Maps

Each data structure implementation is accompanied by small practical challenges or integrations into ongoing projects.

Purpose of this Repository

This repository is meant to:

- Showcase my progression as a developer and aspiring security engineer.
- Demonstrate applied learning over time.
- Serve as a transparent log of both accomplishments and challenges.
- Inspire others to pursue self-directed learning through structured, project-driven exploration.
